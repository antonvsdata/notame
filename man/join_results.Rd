NOTE: this function is deprecated as the results part of a MetaboSet object does not exist anymore. Use \code{\link{join_fData}} instead!
Join a new data frame of results to a MetaboSet object. The data frame needs to have a column "Feature_ID".
This function is usually called on the results of one of the statistics functions.

colnames(fData(with_results))
