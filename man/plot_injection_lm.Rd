\arguments{
\item{object}{A MetaboSet object}

\item{all_features}{logical, should all features be used? If FALSE (the default), flagged features are removed before visualization.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object
}
\description{
Plots histograms of p-values from linear regression model, where each feature is predicted
