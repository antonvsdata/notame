\usage{
perform_t_test(object, formula_char, all_features = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a MetaboSet object}

\item{formula_char}{character, the formula to be used in the linear model (see Details)
Defaults to "Feature ~ group_col(object)}

\item{all_features}{should all features be included in FDR correction?}

\item{...}{additional parameters to t.test}
}
\value{
data frame with the results
}
\description{
Performs t-tests, the R default is Welch's t-test (unequal variances), use var.equal = TRUE
for Student's t-test
}
\details{
The model is fit on combined_data(object). Thus, column names
in pData(object) can be specified. To make the formulas flexible, the word "Feature"
must be used to signal the role of the features in the formula. "Feature" will be replaced
by the actual Feature IDs during model fitting. For example, if testing for equality of
means in study groups, use "Feature ~ Group".
}
\examples{
t_test_results <- perform_t_test(drop_qcs(merged_sample), formula_char = "Feature ~ Group")
