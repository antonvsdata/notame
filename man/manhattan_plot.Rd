\arguments{
\item{object}{a MetaboSet object or a data frame. If x is a MetaboSet object, fData(x) is used.
If x is a data frame, it is used as is.}

\item{x, p}{the column names of x-axis and p-values}

\item{effect}{column name of effect size (should have negative and positive values).}

\item{p_fdr}{column name of FDR corrected p-values, used to draw a line showing the fdr-corrected significance level}

\item{color}{column name used to color the plots}

\item{p_breaks}{a numerical vector of the p_values to show on the y-axis}

\item{fdr_limit}{the significance level used in the experiment}

\item{x_lim, y_lim}{numerical vectors of length 2 for manually setting the axis limits}

\item{color_scale}{the color scale as returned by a ggplot function}

\item{title, subtitle}{the title and subtitle of the plot}

\item{...}{parameters passed to \code{\link[ggplot2]{geom_point}},
such as shape and alpha values. New aesthetics can
also be passed using \code{mapping = aes(...)}.}
}
\value{
a ggplot object

\description{
Draws a (directed) Manhattan plot of p-values and versus e.g. retention time or mass-to-charge ratio.
If effect size and direction is supplied, the -log10(p-value) on the y-axis will be multiplied
by the direction (sign) of the effect, so part of the points will "drop" from the p = 1 (-log10(p) = 0) line.
This results in a so-called directed Manhattan plot.
}
\examples{
# naturally, this looks messy as there are not enough p-values
lm_results <- perform_lm(drop_qcs(merged_sample), formula_char = "Feature ~ Group")
lm_data <- dplyr::left_join(fData(merged_sample), lm_results)
# Traditional Manhattan plot from data frame
manhattan_plot(lm_data,
  x = "Average_Mz",
  p = "GroupB_P", p_fdr = "GroupB_P_FDR",
  fdr_limit = 0.1
)
# Directed Manhattan plot from MetaboSet
with_results <- join_fData(merged_sample, lm_results)
manhattan_plot(with_results,
  x = "Average_Mz", effect = "GroupB_Estimate",
  p = "GroupB_P", p_fdr = "GroupB_P_FDR",
  fdr_limit = 0.1
)
