\usage{
save_subject_line_plots(
  object,
  all_features = FALSE,
  prefix,
  format = "emf",
  x = time_col(object),
  id = subject_col(object),
  title = "Feature_ID",

}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a MetaboSet object}

\item{all_features}{logical, should all features be used? If FALSE (the default), flagged features are removed before visualization.}

\item{prefix}{character, a file path prefix added to the file paths}

\item{format}{character, format in which the plots should be saved}

\item{x}{character, name of the column to be used as x-axis}

\item{id}{character, name of the column containing subject IDs}

\item{title, subtitle}{column names from fData to use as plot title/filename and subtitle.
Set to NULL for no title/subtitle, this creates running numbered filenames}

\item{color}{character, the column name to color the lines by (optional)}

\item{color_scale}{the color scale as returned by a ggplot function}

\item{facet}{character, the column name to facet by (optional, usually same as color)}

\item{...}{other arguments to \code{save_plot} function, like width and height}
}
\description{
Plots the change in the feature abundances as a function of e.g. time.
A line is drawn for each subject and a mean line is added.
A separate plot is drawn and saved for each feature.
