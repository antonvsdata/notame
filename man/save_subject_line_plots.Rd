\arguments{
\item{object}{a MetaboSet object}

\item{all_features}{logical, should all features be used?
If FALSE (the default), flagged features are removed before visualization.}

\item{save}{logical, if false, the plots are not saved but returned as a list}

\item{file_path}{character, a file path for PDF or prefix added to the file paths for other formats}

\item{format}{character, format in which the plots should be saved}

\item{x}{character, name of the column to be used as x-axis}

\item{id}{character, name of the column containing subject IDs}

\item{title, subtitle}{column names from fData to use as plot title/filename and subtitle.
Set to NULL for no title/subtitle, this creates running numbered filenames}

\item{color}{character, the column name to color the lines by (optional)}

\item{color_scale}{the color scale as returned by a ggplot function}

\item{facet}{character, the column name to facet by (optional, usually same as color)}

\item{text_base_size}{integer, base size for text in figures}

\item{line_width}{numeric, width of the lines}

\item{mean_line_width}{numeric, width of the mean line}

\item{title_line_length}{integer, maximum length of the title line in characters, passed to stringr::str_wrap}

\item{theme}{a ggplot theme to be added to the plot}

\item{...}{other arguments to graphic device functions, like width and height}
}
\description{
Plots the change in the feature abundances as a function of e.g. time.
A line is drawn for each subject and a mean line is added.
A separate plot is drawn and saved for each feature.
