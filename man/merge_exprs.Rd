\title{Partially replace exprs field with new values}
\usage{
merge_exprs(object, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a MetaboSet object}

\item{y}{matrix containing new values to be merged into exprs}
}
\value{
a MetaboSet object with the new exprs values
}
\description{
Replaces a subset of data in exprs of an object by new values.
Used after an operation such as imputation is computed only for a subset of features or samples
such as only good-quality features that have not been flagged.
This function is mainly used internally, but can be useful.

\examples{
ex_set <- merged_sample[1:5, 1:5]

# Create a matrix of replacment values for rows 1, 3, 5 and columns 1, 3, 4
replacement <- matrix(1:9, ncol = 3,
                      dimnames = list(featureNames(ex_set)[c(1, 3, 5)],
