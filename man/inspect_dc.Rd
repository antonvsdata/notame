\title{Flag the results of drift correction}
\usage{
inspect_dc(orig, dc, check_quality, condition = "RSD_r < 0 & D_ratio_r < 0")
}
\arguments{
\item{orig}{a MetaboSet object, before drift correction}

\item{dc}{a MetaboSet object, after drift correction}

\item{check_quality}{logical, whether quality should be monitored.}

\item{condition}{a character specifying the condition, see Details}
}
\value{
MeatboSet object
}
\description{
Determines whether the drift correction worked.
The primary reason is to search for features where there were too many missing values in the QCs,
so it was not possible to run drift correction. If the drift correction is run on the original
values (not log-transformed), then there is also a need to check that the correction did not result
in any negative values. This can sometimes happen if the prediction curve takes an extreme shape.
If quality is monitored,
a quality condition is checked for each feature. If the condition is fulfilled, the drift corrected feature is retained,
otherwise the original feature is retained and the drift corrected feature is discarded.
The result of this operation is recorded in the feature data.
}
\details{
The \code{condition} parameter should be a character giving a condition compatible
with dplyr::filter. The condition is applied on the \strong{changes} in the quality metrics
RSD, RSD_r, D_ratio and D_ratio_r. For example, the default is "RSD_r < 0 and D_ratio_r < 0",
meaning that both RSD_r and D_ratio_r need to decrease in the drift correction, otherwise the
drift corrected feature is discarded and the original is retained.
